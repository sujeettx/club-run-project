    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>
      The Sport Club Program at <i>Lovely Professional University </i> comprised
      of sport clubs formed, developed, governed, and administered by the
      student membership working in conjunction with the Office of Intramurals
      and Recreation, a unit of the Division of Student Life. The key to the
      <br />
      success of this program is student leadership, interest, involvement, and
      participation. The Sport Club Council with advisement of the Office of
      Intramurals and Recreation has created this manual in order to provide
      officers with the structural framework necessary for clubs to gain
      recognition, develop leadership skills, and run safe, efficient programs.
      The policies <br />
      and procedures contained herein apply to all of the clubs. Sport club
      members, officers, coaches, and the faculty/staff advisor are required to
      read, understand, and follow the procedures outlined in this manual.
      Questions regarding the policies <br />
      and procedures within this manual should be directed to the Director of
      Intramurals and Recreation or the Sport Club Council executive board.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Purpose of the Sport Club Program</u></h2>
    <p>
      The Sport Club program at <i>Lovely Professional University</i> offers the
      community an opportunity to participate in a broad variety of sports and
      recreational activities. All programs are based on student interest and
      designed to enhance the <i>vertos </i> experience by creating an
      environment where students can unite in diverse groups to achieve common
      goals and objectives while encouraging healthy lifestyles. Sport Clubs
      provide a valuable learning experience through student involvement in
      fundraising, public relations, organization, administration, budgeting,
      scheduling, teaching, and leadership development. The clubs with the most
      success and stability are those with active members and dedicated
