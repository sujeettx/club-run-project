    <h2><u>Football</u></h2>

    <p>
      A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the
      various team sports known as football. Such teams could be selected to
      play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club,
      group, state or nation, an all-star team or even selected as a
      hypothetical team (such as a Dream Team or Team of the Century) and never
      play an actual match. There are a number of references to traditional,
      ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the
      world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
      codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th
      century. The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of
      football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
      controlled Empire.[8] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional
      codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
      incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to
      maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football League was founded in
      England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions.
      During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
      become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

    <h2><u>Badminton</u></h2>

    <p>
      Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock
      across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common
      forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles"
      (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor
      activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular
      indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the
      racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court. Each
      side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.
      Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been
      called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing
      side. The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic
      projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other
      sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the
      shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top
      speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the
      shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature. The game developed in
      British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock.
      European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very
      popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992,
      badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles,
      women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles
      added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands
      excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength,
      speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor
      coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

    <h2><u>Swimming</u></h2>

    <p>
        swimming, in recreation and sports, the propulsion of the body through water by combined arm and leg motions and the natural flotation of the body. Swimming as an exercise is popular as an all-around body developer and is particularly useful in therapy and as exercise for physically handicapped persons. It is also taught for lifesaving purposes. For activities that involve swimming, see also diving, lifesaving, surfing, synchronized swimming, underwater diving, and water polo.
